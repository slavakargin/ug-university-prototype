# Mathematical Sciences Undergraduate Program (Prototype)

Welcome to the Department of Mathematical Sciences undergraduate program. We offer flexible and rigorous pathways in mathematics, data science & statistics, and actuarial science.

This prototype is intended to support a redesign in which **stable program information** lives on the university website, while **frequently updated advising logistics** remain on the department’s internal pages.

## Degrees and tracks

### BA in Mathematical Sciences
The BA program is designed to be flexible and allows students to tailor a course of study to their interests, with room for a second major or minor.

- **Mathematics track (BA)** — broad exposure across core areas of mathematics  
  → [Mathematics track (BA/BS)](content/tracks/pure-math.md)

- **Data Science & Statistics track (BA)** — strong foundation in statistics and modern data tools  
  → [Data Science & Statistics track (BA/BS)](content/tracks/data-science.md)

- **Actuarial Science track (BA)** — preparation for actuarial exams and careers  
  → [Actuarial Science track (BA/BS)](content/tracks/actuarial.md)

### BS in Mathematical Sciences
The BS program is more intensive and is especially appropriate for students considering graduate study or mathematically demanding careers. BS students are encouraged to consult with advisors early and plan schedules carefully.

See the track pages above for BA/BS summaries and links to the authoritative requirements.
